Shows a Flickr photoset on a Map. Photos need to be geotagged in Flickr for this to work.

You need a Flickr API key and a Google Maps API key.

Edit the Google Maps include URL (with your API key) in index.html

Edit the Flickr API key in postcardmap.js

Make sure your map element has id="map" in your DOM, then you're pretty much done.
